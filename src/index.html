                    The link-state algorithm computes the least-cost path between a source and
                    destination using complete, global knowledge about the network. That is, the algorithm
                    takes the connectivity between all nodes and all link costs as inputs. This then requires
                    that the algorithm somehow obtain this information before actually performing the
                    calculation. For the calculation itself, each node runs Dijkstra's algorithm on the
                    global link-state information, and constructs a routing table that allows the node to
                    know which hop to send information to, provided it needs to reach a certain destination.

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <p>
                    Link-state algorithms allow for more efficient use of network resources because they only 
                    send updates when there is a change in the network topology. This is in contrast to 
                    distance-vector algorithms, which require periodic updates even if there has been no change 
                    in the network topology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Link-state algorithms converge more quickly than distance-vector algorithms because they are 
                    based on a more accurate representation of the network topology. Each node has a complete view 
                    of the network, which allows it to calculate the shortest path to every other node more efficiently.

            <div>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <p>
                    Link-state algorithms require more memory and processing power compared to distance-vector 
                    algorithms because each node needs to maintain a complete view of the network topology. This can 
                    be a challenge for large networks with many nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Link-state algorithms rely on a central controller or network management system to distribute 
                    link-state packets and manage the link-state database. This can create a single point of failure 
                    and make the network more vulnerable to attacks.

        <h2>Distance-Vector</h2>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The Distance-Vector algorithm is an example of a decentralized algorithm, where the calculation 
                    of the least-cost path is carried out in an iterative, distributed manner by the routers. No 
                    node has complete information about the costs of all network links. Instead, each node begins 
                    with only the knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links. Then, through an 
                    iterative process of calculation and exchange of information with its neighbouring nodes, a node 
                    gradually calculates the least-cost path to a destination or set of destinations.
                </p>

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <p>
                    The updates in distance-vector algorithms are based on local information, which makes them 
                    computationally lightweight. Each node only needs to exchange information with its immediate 
                    neighbors, which reduces the amount of network traffic and computation required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distance-vector algorithms typically converge quickly to a stable routing solution. This is 
                    because the updates are based on local information and are performed iteratively until no 
                    further changes occur.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <p>
                    Distance-vector algorithms can be inefficient in high-traffic networks, as each node periodically 
                    sends its entire routing table to its neighbors. This can generate a significant amount of 
                    network traffic, which can cause delays and congestion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The count-to-infinity problem can occur in a distance-vector routing algorithm when a node becomes 
                    unreachable due to a link failure or some other reason. Other nodes may continue to advertise their 
                    distance to the unreachable node, which can cause nodes to include the unreachable node in their 
                    distance vectors with an infinite cost. If nodes do not exchange their updated distance vectors 
                    quickly enough, they may continue to advertise outdated information to each other, which can cause 
                    the network to become unstable. Certain workarounds involve additions to the algorithm, such as
                    "split horizon" (where nodes do not send information about routes back to where they learned it
                    from), or poison reverse, but neither are very effective and thus link-state algorithms are
                    preferred instead.
